Description: This package implements an empirical Bayes,
    multi-state Cox model.Different groups of regression
    coefficients can be defined, with coefficients of the
    same group sharing the same Gaussian prior. It takes
    as input a data set in 'long format' and generates
    estimates of relative hazards, cumulative hazard
    functions and transition probabilities. It relies 
    on packages 'survival' and 'mstate'
    and incorporates some 
    of their functions to reduce upstream dependency.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.5.0),
    survival (>= 2.44-1.1),
    mstate (>= 0.2.11)
Imports:
    Rcpp,
    HDInterval,
    stats,
    utils,
