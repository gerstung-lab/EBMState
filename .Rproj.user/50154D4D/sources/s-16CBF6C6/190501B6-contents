Description: This package implements an empirical Bayes,
    multi-state Cox model.Different groups of regression
    coefficients can be defined, with coefficients of the
    same group sharing the same Gaussian prior. It takes
    as input a data set in 'long format' and generates
    estimates of relative hazards, cumulative hazard
    functions and transition probabilities.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.5.0),
    survival (== 2.44-1.1),
    parallel,
    RColorBrewer,
    mstate (== 0.2.11)
